# Booking Application

This is a flight booking application, created in order to exercise
patterns and concepts such as hexagonal architecture, domain driven design
event driven, CQS and modular monoliths with clear boundaries. 

## The problem

In most concurrent applications, such this one, the common problem is the
relation between concurrency and consistency. In this example I've tried
to exercise the solution for it + the simplest way to solve the increasing
complexity of such system.

## Core concepts

- Domain Driven Design
- Modular monoliths
- CQRS
- Event Driven Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Distributed Concurrency

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring
- Docker compose
- RabbitMQ
